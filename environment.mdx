You will get access to your own Onboarded account and accompanying dashboard. This dashboard will allow you to administer onboarding and provide data and analytics about the ongoing onboarding process. The Onboarded team will partner closely with you on using the dashboard.

As part of the setup, we will assist you through the following steps in the Onboarded dashboard.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Adding Users">
    In order to create users within the Onboarded application, we will need to collect key information needed to identify the individual user as well as define their data access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Loading initial “entity” data">
    “Entities” in the Onboarded platform are the core data objects involved in the hiring process: employers, clients, jobs & work location. In order to align the Onboarded policy engine to your hiring workflow, we need to keep these entities in sync with the ATS. Entity data is what triggers the suggested tasks to be completed in onboarding.

    Loading entity data can be done manually in the dashboard to test a small amount of data. Larger scale creation can be done through the Onboarded API (e.g. Create Employers).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Creating forms / task templates">
    We need to define the potential tasks that may need to be completed by workers during onboarding. While templates for government forms to be filled (e.g. I-9 or W-4) are already created by Onboarded and included by default, there are numerous other tasks that customers may want to add and/or customize, including general information to be collected (e.g. t-shirt size, work availability), links to actions that need to be completed in third-party systems (e.g. background check, drug screening), client-specific acknowledgments that need to be signed (e.g. recreational drug use policy, company code of conduct), or job-specific certifications that need to be uploaded (e.g. forklift operator, food safety handling), etc...
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configuring policies">
    Policies determine when tasks should be applied to a worker. These policies can be driven off of any data in the system, though they are most commonly driven by home location, work location, client, or job type. Some policies are already pre-configured and immutable (because they are determined by federal or state law), but others can be customized as you need (e.g. based on client requirements).

    When clients approach your team with new or changing requirements, policy edits and additions will be made similarly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

While most of this must currently be done within the Onboarded application, we plan to release the ability to embed UI components of the following processes within your own application and would love to discuss your vision in this area.
