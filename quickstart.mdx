To support an optimal candidate onboarding experience with minimal development, we will prioritize data transfer between systems on both ends of the process. To provide an optimal recruiter experience, we will leverage the Onboarded engine to reduce the amount of manual selection that a recruiter needs to do for every candidate.

The experience will be driven completely through the Onboarded API.

## Setting The Scene 
ACME Inc. is ready has decided to hire Ryan Jackson to be their first employee for their widget shop. Ryan will be a cashier. Ryan Jackson will need to complete their I-9 and W-4 to start working. Let's get Ryan onboarded! 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Employer" icon={"building-memo"} iconType={"solid"} >
    Because this is ACME Inc.'s first employee, we need to create an `employer` object in Onboarded to create the `employee` object under. You can create the `employer` at any time. An `employer` can exist without any `employees`. 

    To create the `employer` we'll use the below payload with [POST /v1/employers](/api-reference/employers/create-an-employer). 

    ```json 
    {
      "name": "ACME Inc.",
      "ein": "123456789",
      "phone": "123-456-7890",
      "entity_structure": "corporation",
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Widget St",
        "secondary": "Suite 123",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip": "10000",
        "country": "USA"
      }
    }
    ```
    The only required fields to create an employer are the `name`, `ein`, and `address`. You may also use the API to populate `custom_attributes` which must be created through the dashboard ahead of time.

    You should get back a response that looks like this:

    ```json
    {
      "id": "er_HVf2NFdLDi1Bin3LgUmZA", // The er_ will be the same, but the string will differ
      "name": "ACME Inc.",
      "ein": "123456789",
      "dba_name": null,
      "phone": "123-456-7890",
      "employee_count": null,
      "entity_structure": "corporation",
      "naics_code": null,
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Widget St",
        "secondary": "Suite 123",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip": "10003",
        "country": "USA"
      },
      "custom_attributes": {},
      "created_at": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z", // yours will be different
      "updated_at": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z" // yours will be different
    }
    ```
    Save the `id`, you'll need it for later!

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create the Employee" icon="user" iconType="solid">
    Now we need to create the `employee`. Similar to `employers` the `employee` object doesn't need an `employer`, `client`, or `job` to exist on the account to be created. The `employee` is associated with the account, not with any other entity until creating the `placement`, which is next up. 

    To create the `employee` we'll use the below payloadd with [POST /v1/employees](/api-reference/employees/create-an-employee)

    ```json
    {
      "first_name": "Ryan",
      "middle_name": "Micah",
      "last_name": "Jackson",
      "email": "ryan@example.com", // nothing will be sent to the email provided here
      "phone": "1234567890",
      "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
      "social_security_number": "123-45-6789",
      "has_middle_name": true,
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Random St",
        "secondary": "",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip": "10000",
        "country": "USA"
      }
    }
    ```
    The only required fields when creating an `employee` are the `first_name`, `last_name`, and `address` (except for secondary). Similar to the `employer` object, you may use the API to populate `custom_attributes` which must be created through the dashboard ahead of time.

    You should get a response that looks like this:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "ee_oYhyCTBJJABaQUr5FNir8", // yours will be different, except for the ee_
        "first_name": "Ryan",
        "middle_name": "Micah",
        "last_name": "Jackson",
        "email": "ryan@example.com",
        "phone": "1234567890",
        "date_of_birth": "1990-01-01",
        "social_security_number": "123-45-6789",
        "has_middle_name": true,
        "address": {
            "street": "123 Random St",
            "secondary": null,
            "city": "New York",
            "state": "NY",
            "zip": "10000",
            "country": "USA"
        },
        "custom_attributes": {},
        "created_at": "2024-05-14T21:46:48.861Z", // yours will be different
        "updated_at": "2024-05-14T21:46:48.861Z" //  yours will be different
    }
    ```

    Save the `id`, you'll need it for the next step!
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a Placement" icon="arrow-right-from-arc" iconType="solid">
    Now that we have created our `employee` and `employer` objects, we can place Ryan with his new `employer`. `Placements` is how Onboarded knows what `employer`, `job`, and `client` an `employee` should be associated with. Further, creating a `placement` triggers the policy engine. When the policy engine is triggered, it looks at all the associated entity data and determines what tasks are applicable for this `placement`.

    To create the `placement` we'll use the below payloadd with [POST /v1/Placements](/api-reference/placements/create-an-placement)

    ```json
    {
      "employee_id": " ", // use the ID from the "Create an Employee" step earlier
      "employer_id": " " // use the ID from the "Create an Employer" step earlier
      "create_tasks": true
    }
    ```
    The only required field when creating a `placement` is the `employee_id`, all other fields are optional. However, it's not often that you'll have a task that is relevant across the entire account. Therefore, it's always recommended that you associate an `employee` with at least an `employer` object. 

    You should get a response that looks like this:

    ```json
    {
        "id": "pla_f99Q8OHWoV3b1oFFrupHF", // this will be differnet, other than the pla_
        "employee_id": "ee_", // this should be the ID you use for employee_id
        "employer_id": "er_", // this should be the ID you use for employer_id
        "created_at": "2024-05-14T23:27:37.480Z", // this will be different 
        "suggested_tasks": [
            {
                "form_id": "form_01hvsp3rp6f0paqn0wq2cd61dh"
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

    You may get back more `forms` depending on how many were created during your account set up. `form_id` can be used to manually create tasks but when `create_tasks` is set to `true` they will automatically be created instead. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Onboarding URL" icon="link" iconType="solid">
    Once the `placement` has been created, we can generate an onboarding URL for the employee! The onboarding URL is our hosted-experience whereby the employee goes through each task field-by-field. This experience may include an e-signature step, which will capture the users's IP address, signed timestamp, and signature. 

    To create the onboarding URL we'll use the following GET request [/v1/employees/:id/onboarding](/api-reference/employees/get-an-employee-onboarding-url), where `:id` is the `ID` from the `employee` object we created earlier.

    This will generate an employee-facing onboarding URL. You can also use query parameters to create an employer-facing onboarding URL which will contain tasks assigned to the employer. This is particularly relevant for forms like the I-9 which require an employer to review the uploaded documents to establish work authorization. 

    You should get a response that looks like this:

    ```json
    {
        "url": "https://app.onboarded.com/onboarding/auth?token=<token>" // the token will be provided in the response
    }
    ```

  ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations, you've created an onboarding URL!** This URL can be sent to Ryan and will automatically collect all of the data they provide. Any tasks that generate a PDF, such as the W-4, are [also accessible](/api-reference/tasks/get-a-task-pdf) once completed.
