To support an optimal candidate onboarding experience with minimal development, we will prioritize data transfer between systems on both ends of the process. To provide an optimal recruiter experience, we will leverage the Onboarded engine to reduce the amount of manual selection that a recruiter needs to do for every candidate.

The experience will be driven completely through the Onboarded API.

## Setting The Scene 
ACME Inc. is ready has decided to hire Ryan Jackson to be their first employee for their widget shop. Ryan will be a cashier. Ryan Jackson will need to complete their I-9 and W-4 to start working. Let's get Ryan onboarded! 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create the Employer" icon={"building-memo"} iconType={"solid"} >
    Because this is ACME Inc.'s first employee, we need to create an `employer` object in Onboarded to create the `employee` object under. 

    <Note>You can create the `employer` at any time, it doesn't have to be during the first hire! An `employer` can exist without any `employees`.</Note> 

    To create the `employer` we'll use the [Employer API](/api-reference/employers).
