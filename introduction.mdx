Onboarded is introducing a new paradigm in employee onboarding by delivering an **API-first platform designed to automate and streamline onboarding-related compliance with precision**. The platform intelligently ingests applicant data collected in an ATS during the recruitment processes, dynamically identifying and presenting the specific onboarding task(s) for each candidate. Through a customized URL, candidates are guided through a personalized onboarding experience where they can complete, sign forms, and access necessary documentation - all from within the app. 

At its core, Onboarded tackles the multifaceted challenges of onboarding head-on. Our system is built for depth, offering custom integration options and the capability to navigate the myriad of edge cases inherent in staffing and recruitment. This document outlines a streamlined approach for integration with Onboarded, designed to fast-track implementation and reduce time to market. This initial phase focuses on optimizing data integration, with a minimal need for investment in custom user interfaces, ensuring a rapid deployment that does not compromise the quality or compliance of the solution.
