To support an optimal candidate onboarding experience with minimal development, we will prioritize data transfer between systems on both ends of the process. To provide an optimal recruiter experience, we will leverage the Onboarded engine to reduce the amount of manual selection that a recruiter needs to do for every candidate.

The experience will be driven completely through the Onboarded API.
