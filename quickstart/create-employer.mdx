title: "Create Employer"
---

Because this is ACME Inc.'s first employee, we need to create an `employer` object in Onboarded to create the `employee` object under. You can create the `employer` at any time. An `employer` can exist without any `employees`. 

To create the `employer` we'll use the below payload with [POST /v1/employers](/api-reference/employers). 

```json 
{
    "name": "ACME Inc.",
    "ein": "123456789",
    "phone": "123-456-7890",
    "entity_structure": "corporation",
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Widget St",
        "secondary": "Suite 123",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip": "10000",
        "country": "USA"
    }
}
```
The only required fields to create an employer are the `name`, `ein`, and `address`. You may also use the API to populate `custom_attributes` which must be created through the dashboard ahead of time.

You should get back a response that looks like this:

```json
{
    "id": "er_HVf2NFdLDi1Bin3LgUmZA", // The er_ will be the same, but the string will differ
    "name": "ACME Inc.",
    "ein": "123456789",
    "dba_name": null,
    "phone": "123-456-7890",
    "employee_count": null,
    "entity_structure": "corporation",
    "naics_code": null,
    "address": {
        "street": "123 Widget St",
        "secondary": "Suite 123",
        "city": "New York",
        "state": "NY",
        "zip": "10003",
        "country": "USA"
    },
    "custom_attributes": {},
    "created_at": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z",
    "updated_at": "2023-11-07T05:31:56Z"
}
```

Next, let's create the employee.
