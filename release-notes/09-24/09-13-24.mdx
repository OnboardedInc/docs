    We've updated the login page to support forced Google oAuth authentication when logging into the dashboard. If your account has forced Google oAuth turned on, you will be directed to the Google oAuth screen which will autenticate you and redirect you to Onboarded. Otherwise you will proceed to the login page as normal to use your username and password. 

    If you're interested in turning on forced Google oAuth authentication for your account, reach out to us at support@onboarded.com.
