## Webhooks
Webhooks are a way to get more real-time notifications from the API. When an event happens in the system, we'll send a POST request to the URL you specify. You can configure webhooks in the Onboarded Dashboard.

### Security
The token from the Onboarded Dashboard Webhook UI is used to generate a signature for each webhook request. This signature is a hex-encoded hmac hash using webhook request body. The signature is included in the webhook request header property webhook-signature. To validate a webhook came from Onboarded and has not been tampered with, you need to use the token and the webhook payload you received to generate a sha256 digest and compare it against the value in the header. If it matches, the request is valid and has not been tampered with.
